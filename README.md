# Hardware Product & Manufacturing Governance Portfolio

This repository serves as an entry point to structured hardware product development and manufacturing governance cases.

The focus is on execution discipline, stage-gated NPI control, structural stability, and production authorization under real mass production conditions.

## Case Index

### 1. Strategic Thin-Wall Steel Coin Cell Program (2022–2023)  
Pre-award dedicated line construction, station-level SPC/CPK governance, multi-scheme DOE execution, and dual-line NPI (semi-automatic + automation) under stage-gated statistical control.

### 2. Fully Custom 4G IoT System (2016–2019)
System-level integration governance across multi-module hardware, structured EVT → DVT → PVT advancement, and production-line validation control.

### 3. Precision Mechanical Structure Governance (2018–2019)
Multi-material structural stability control, tight mating discipline, durability validation, and mass production authorization under precision constraints.

Each project involved supplier sourcing,coordination, cost structure control, quality validation, and production ramp stabilization.

## Positioning

Owner-level governance across hardware product development and NPI programs.

Accountable for stage authorization, statistical process readiness, and cross-vendor execution alignment under real manufacturing constraints.

Programs governed through gate discipline rather than reactive issue handling.

## Governance Philosophy

Program control structured around:

- Gate-based authorization logic (EVT → DVT → PVT → MP)
- Gate-based statistical capability governance (yield / SPC / CPK compliance required for stage progression)
- Risk register governance and DFMEA discipline
- Tooling and automation stability validation
- Cross-functional milestone synchronization
- Production ramp authorization based on measurable exit criteria
